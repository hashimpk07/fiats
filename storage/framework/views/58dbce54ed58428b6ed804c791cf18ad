        <p>Proudly presenting the portal fiatscriptura.org for the registration of the book writing competition, “Fiat Scriptura” which is entering to the fourth season in the year of 2017. We thank all our past participants for making the competition a big success.</p><br>
        <p>Fiat scriptura is an a endeavor by Fiat Mission started in the year 2013. To familiarise the ability of writing to the people. It appeared to many as a great opportunity to get closer to the writing practises. The overwhelming success of the program promote us to take forward the competition to the coming years and better heights.</p><br>
        <p>Our past competitions proved the need of a competition and its importance with the participation of more than 3000 participants in the years before. We are expecting a minimum 30% growth a year and be one of the leading competition of its kind in the country soon in coming years.</p><br>
        <p>New updates on the contest are coming soon. Stay tuned.</p>
